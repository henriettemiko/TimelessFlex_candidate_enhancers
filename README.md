### Description

Part of my framework [TimelessFlex](https://github.com/henriettemiko/TimelessFlex) to identify and cluster candidate enhancers based on time-course ATAC-seq and H3K27ac ChIP-seq data. The data set consists of 4 time points of sex determination in mouse (XX_10.5, XY_10.5, XX_13.5, XY_13.5) (Garcia-Moreno et al., *Developmental Biology*, 2019).
